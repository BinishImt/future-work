## Problem Statement

Collecting fingerprints dataset by using Autoencoders recreating fingerprints

## Architecture

## Explanation

The dataset that Iâ€™m using is the FVC2002 fingerprint dataset. It consists of 4 different sensor fingerprints namely Low-cost Optical Sensor, Low-cost Capacitive Sensor, Optical Sensor and Synthetic Generator, each sensor having varying image sizes. The dataset has 320 images, 80 images per sensor.

## Output
Finally, you can see that the validation loss and the training loss both are in sync. It shows that your model is not overfitting: the validation loss is decreasing and not increasing, plotted graph on 'Training Loss' and 'Validation Loss'
